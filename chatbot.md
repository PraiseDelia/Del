MECHANISM OF A CHATBOT
Chatbot or bot – is a computer program that simulates a natural human conversation. 
Users communicate with a chatbot via the chat interface or by voice, like how they would talk to a real person. Chatbots interpret and process user's words or phrases and 
give an instant pre-set answer.
There are three main types of chatbots:
Rule-based chatbots
This is the simplest type of chatbots today. People interact with these bots by clicking on buttons and using pre-defined options. To give relevant answers these chatbots require people to make a few selections.

Intellectually independent chatbots
These bots use Machine Learning (ML) which helps the chatbot learn from user’s inputs and requests.

ML is the ability of the computer to learn by itself from the data, recognize patterns and decide with minimal human interference.

Intellectually independent chatbots are trained to understand specific keywords and phrases that trigger bot’s reply. With the time they train themselves to understand more and more questions. You can say they learn and train from experience.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a simulation of human intelligence. AI is the area of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines that work and “think” as people.
Mechanism:
Chatbots are mainly based on their speech Recognition API and Speech synthesis API. Chatbots use Machine Learning, AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand people.

NLP is the ability of the computer to understand and analyze human speech, find the right response and reply in understandable for a human language.

The goal of NLP is to make the interaction between computers and humans feel like communication between two people. With the help of NLP people can freely interact with chatbots asking a question.
